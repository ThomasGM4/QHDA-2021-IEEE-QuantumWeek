## Abstract

How do we streamline the design and analysis of innovative superconducting quantum processors? The need for the scaling of and the growing diversity of circuit architectures makes this a question of central importance. Good solutions will need to smoothly orchestrate expertise and tools from traditionally disparate worlds. The microwave circuitry composing superconducting quantum chips can be readily simulated in classical software, but additional quantum analysis is required in order to find the Hamiltonian used to fully model the dynamics of the system, a necessary step to properly tune the quantum device. For large systems, this can be a very time consuming and complex process, requiring numerous iterations of computationally large simulations and slow feedback loops. The goal of this workshop is to bring together the diverse collection of experts in academia, industry and government, from EDA specialists to microwave engineers to quantum physicists, required to answer that question. They will discuss the current state of the field, such as established best practices and the ecosystem of open-source and commercial software. Vendors will showcase their proposed solutions for improved design and simulation, discussing where advancements are still necessary. Finally, state-of-the-art open-source endeavors that have been proposed will be presented, focusing on the community driven development and where such tools have been successful. The field has a growing need to establish software tools to enable the fast and easy design and analysis of quantum chips; this workshop aims to provide a forum for the community to do so.

But the qubit paradigm gave a tremendous boost to this field. While old samples immediately came out of the drawer for looking more at their quantum coherence, it was clear that a radical and painful redo of the experimental approach was needed to really step positively forward towards Josephson quantum computing. I will touch on the major steps of this redo, about ten years in the making. For us at IBM at the time, it was a bruising but invigorating experience. |

### 1:00 - 2:30 Commercial Software Session
| Time<br/> &nbsp; | Speaker<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Topic<br/> &nbsp; |
|------|---------|-------|
|1:00  |**Brian Rautio** <br/> VP Operations *@* Sonnet Software |  "EM Simulation—when does it break?"  |
|      | <img src="https://github.com/ThomasGM4/QHDA-2021-IEEE-QuantumWeek/blob/main/Resources/rautio.jpg" alt="Rautio" width="200">| As a large, multi-decade industry full of strong and reliable products, it’s easy to trust the results of your EM simulator. However, at Sonnet, we can understand that simulation is inherently going to be wrong to some degree. The question we always need to ask is, “How wrong is my answer?” It’s a spectrum and the error margins may be insignificant to alarming, and the types of things we do and the way we drive our simulators can have a significant impact on that. Pushing the limit of physics means that we may be pushing the limits of our EM simulation as well, and this talk will help navigate that concept with awareness.|

Linking the Hamiltonian world to the EDA design world must be done.  From there, the engineer needs to select the right EDA technologies and understand how to apply these.  Lastly, they must design the qubit in an efficient and effective manner.   This paper explores the various challenges the Quantum hardware designer faces, the technology available to them, and requirements for an efficient workflow. |

The quantitative modeling of such circuits is a critical cornerstone in research and development of this hardware platform. The open-source package “scqubits” streamlines the modeling of superconducting qubits and coupled circuit QED systems. This presentation will highlight package capabilities including the prediction of spectra and coherence properties, the construction of composite systems of multiple qubits and harmonic modes, and the ease of performing multi-dimensional parameter sweeps of circuit QED systems. *We gratefully acknowledge support by the AFOSR under grant FA9550-20-1-0271.* |

|      | <img src="https://github.com/ThomasGM4/QHDA-2021-IEEE-QuantumWeek/blob/main/Resources/heinsoo.jpg" alt="Heinsoo" width="200">|<p>The research field of quantum computing with superconducting qubits is maturing. There is still a lack of established open-source tools for design of quantum processing unit (QPU) elements, chips, and lithography masks. In some research groups, this task is still done by manually drawing the polygons or using locally developed software components prone to human errors and limited scalability. </p><p>We present KQCircuits, a GPLv3-licensed tool developed at IQM Finland, that enables designing QPU out of parameterized elements with geometric relations. The basic elements, chips and mask can be drawn programmatically and using a graphical user interface. Masks and simulation scripts can be exported to establish a complete and robust workflow. Most standard QPU elements, and some single and multi-layer chips are provided as examples.</p><p>With KQCircuits, quantum engineers are empowered to quickly develop new quantum experiments and processors while also having the opportunity to contribute to the codebase and libraries to help their peers and push the field forward.</p>|
|4:00  |**Boxi Li** <br/> PhD Candidate *@* Forschungszentrum<br/> Jülich | QuTiP | "Quantum Hardware Simulation with QuTiP" |
|      | <img src="https://github.com/ThomasGM4/QHDA-2021-IEEE-QuantumWeek/blob/main/Resources/boxi.jpg" alt="Li" width="200">|Simulating quantum dynamics is of essential importance in the design and engineering of various components in quantum hardware. The Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP), one of the earliest open-source software packages in simulating quantum dynamics, has been widely used in developing qubits, quantum gates and measurement protocols. The package is now being developed under a worldwide collaboration and has grown rapidly in the last few years. In this talk, I will briefly present the basic functionality of the package and introduce a few new features that offer more flexibility in hardware simulation. In particular, in the next major version of QuTiP, qutip-v5, one will be able to define custom data types and ODE solvers as a plug-in package. Moreover, in the new sub-package, qutip-qip, we provide tools for circuit simulation at the level of time evolution, allowing studying various kinds of noise in the numerical simulation. |
